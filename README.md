# Connect 4  
## Description  
A two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertical grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Getting started  
Game ready to play as it loads, with player Red going first. Players can click on hovering empty circles over the columns to drop a disk or click on an empty space itself. Clicks on spaces that don't have a disk below will not place a disk.
Once someone connects four disks, a message renders declaring the winner and stopping functionality. The reset button re-initiates the game.
